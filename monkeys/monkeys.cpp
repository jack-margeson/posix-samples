// Some monkeys are trying to cross a ravine. A single rope traverses the ravine, and
// monkeys can cross hand-over-hand. Up to five monkeys can be hanging on the rope at
// any one time. If there are more than five, then the rope will break, and they will
// all die. Also, if eastward-moving monkeys encounter westward moving monkeys,
// all will fall off and die.
