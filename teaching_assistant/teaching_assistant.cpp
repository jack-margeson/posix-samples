// The university computer science department has a teaching assistant (TA) who
// helps undergraduate students with their programming assignments during
// regular office hours. The TAâ€™s office is rather small and has room for only one
// desk with a chair and computer. There are three chairs in the hallway outside
// the office where students can sit and wait if the TA is currently helping
// another student. 

//When there are no students who need help during office
// hours, the TA sits at the desk and takes a nap. If a student arrives during
// office hours and finds the TA sleeping, the student must awaken the TA to ask
// for help. If a student arrives and finds the TA currently helping another
// student, the student sits on one of the chairs in the hallway and waits. If no
// chairs are available, the student will come back later.
