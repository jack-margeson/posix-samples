// A single-lane bridge connects the two Vermont villages of North Turnbridge
// and South Turnbridge. Farmers in the two villages use this bridge to deliver
// their produce to the neighboring town. The bridge can become deadlocked if a
// northbound and a southbound farmer get on the bridge at the same time.
// (Vermont farmers are stubborn and are unable to back up).
